# ThreadFeeder WPF DEMO

#### **INTRO**

ThreadFeeder was a system to provide A list of Threads feeding on a list of Tasks. 
Each thread would "feed" on the list of tasks  by taking the first task available and executing it.
This was created to optimize performances between multiple repetitive tasks suck as scans. 

I did it in a WPF app because I can. That's all.
